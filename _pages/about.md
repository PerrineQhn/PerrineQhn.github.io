Hello!

I'm a PhD student in machine learning at Stanford University co-advised by [Percy Liang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/) and [Tatsu Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/) and funded by a [Knights-Hennessy Scholarship](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/). 
<!-- I strive to build AI technologies that are simultaneously open/accessible to all and safe/ethical.  -->

Before starting my PhD, I traveled around trying to reconcile my passion for machine learning research and my entrepreneurial mindset.
On the research side, I've worked extensively on learning representations of data that provide guarantees (fairness, robustness, etc) on downstream machine learning.
For example, I've worked on such projects at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) with [Chris Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/) and as part of my [Facebook AI Residency](https://research.fb.com/programs/facebook-ai-residency-program/). 
On the entrepreneurial side, I've applied AI in different startups. For example, developing algorithms at [Grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_(company)) to analyze text in under-research languages (Thai, Khmer, Burmese, ...); or predicting room occupancy at [SBS](https://sensiblebuildingscience.com/) to decrease the carbon footprint of large buildings in Vancouver.

Outside of machine learning I spend my time playing sports with friends (:ski:,:mountain:,:badminton:,:volleyball:,:runner:), traveling, or reading about geopolitics.
